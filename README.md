To launch the application, run gui.py program. Once launched, the user interface will appear divided into three sections. The top left section is used to set the parameters of the robot and the calculated kinematics. After pressing the confirmation button, the second section is unlocked. 

The bottom left section is used to set the parameters of individual segments, such as the length and number of sub-segments. If direct kinematics calculation was selected, it is possible to set the values of the variables of the configuration space in this section with the help of sliders. On the other hand, if inverse kinematics was selected, it is possible to set the position of the end point. 

Throughout the process of setting the parameters of the robot, help will be displayed in the upper part of the interface. Once the robot is set, it can be plotted by pressing the "Plot TDCR" button. The calculated parameters will be displayed in green. To change the entered parameters, simply press the "New position entry" button. 

The "Restart" button serves to restart the program.
